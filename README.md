# RakNet For Unity3D
This is an re-writted version of the wrapper for the native library of the RakNet network engine.

# How to use it
In order to use The raknet network engine in your project, I recommend that you study the test client and server.
See SampleClient.cs and SampleServer.cs

# What's new?
- Updated and optimized native (C++) code
- Added: Bitstream with many variations of writing and reading data (compression, delta, compressed-delta)
- Added: Password for the server
- Added: Data encryption
- Fixed: Setting bandwidth limit
- Added: Getting specific statistics data
- Added: Query Features
- Removed: Unsafe parts of the code

# Query
## Quering data from server
>To request information about the server, just send a UDP packet with the header 'RakNetQuery' to server

>See [Query Sample](https://github.com/ep1s0de3/RakNet_Networking_2/blob/main/Assets/RakQuerySample.cs)

>If the server-side response data is not specified, the server responded with the text message "RakNet Query Response is empty"

>If the server does not respond to requests, then the server is turned off, or the port on which it is running is closed, or the acceptance of requests is disabled by the user

## Set Query Responce on server-side
> To specify the data for the response call BaseServer.SetQueryResponce(byte[] data) (***It is recommended to call at intervals of 2-3 seconds***)

> To disable query processing, call Base Server.AllowQuery(false);

# Attention!
### This version of the network engine is not compatible with others!
### After each update release, I strongly recommend replacing the libraries from the Plugins folder and all scripts to avoid connection errors and crashes.
